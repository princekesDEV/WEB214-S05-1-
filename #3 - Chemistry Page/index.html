    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,
      composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that
      explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>

    <h2>Chemistry Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical
      elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe
      for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are lassified into
      groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>
      Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's
      an example of a <i>chemical reaction</i>:
      <br />
      <br />
      2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O <br /><br />
      This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas
      <em>(H<sub>2</sub>)</em> and oxygen gas <em>(O<sub>2</sub>)</em> to form
      water <em>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</em>.
    </p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>
      <b><tt>Stoichiometry</tt></b> is the calculation of reactants and products
      in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure
      mass and charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a
      molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of
      atoms in an ion.
    </p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>
      Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From
      the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our
      bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
