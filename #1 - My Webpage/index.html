    <p>
      I'm Prince Kesharwani, currently pursuing Full Stack Web Development at
      Masai School, with a strong focus on enhancing my coding skills,
      particularly in problem-solving with efficiency in mind. I prefer
      solutions that minimize the use of extra memory, recursion, or built-in
      functions, aiming for optimized and manual approaches. Additionally, I
      take pride in crafting professional LinkedIn posts that are both engaging
      and visually appealing with well-placed emojis. Recently, Iâ€™ve been
      working on challenges such as removing consecutive duplicate characters
      from strings and determining whether a linked list is a palindrome, diving
      deep into analyzing and improving different code implementations.
